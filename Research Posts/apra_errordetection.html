        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Under the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001, superannuation entities are required to submit a set of reporting forms to APRA (https://www.apra.gov.au/reporting-requirements-for-superannuation-entities). These are typically reviewed by senior actuaries before they are submitted and involve thousands and thousands of rows of numbers per form, and would thus greatly benefit from automation, allowing senior actuaries to devote their time elsewhere. This project is focused specifically on Reporting Form SRF 550.0 Asset Allocation.</p>

        <h2>Explanation of SRF 550.0</h2>
        <p>SRF 550.0 aims to “collect information relating to the asset allocation and investments of registrable superannuation entities”. It comprises of the following columns:</p>
